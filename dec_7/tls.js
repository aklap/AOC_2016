// IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or ABBA. 

// An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as xyyx or abba. 

// IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by square brackets.
